Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae
(which also includes the otters, wolverines, martens, minks, polecats, weasels, and ferrets).
Badgers are a polyphyletic grouping and are not a natural taxonomic grouping: badgers are united by their
squat bodies, adapted for fossorial activity. All belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals.
